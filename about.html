			<p>Here is a poem I like from <cite>Dream Work</cite> by Mary Oliver.</p>
			<blockquote cite="http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2005/03/22">
				<pre>
	Landscape

	Isn't it plain the sheets of moss, except that
	they have no tongues, could lecture
	all day if they wanted about

	spiritual patience? Isn't it clear
	the black oaks along the path are standing
	as though they were the most fragile of flowers?

	Every morning I walk like this around
	the pond, thinking: if the doors of my heart
	ever close, I am as good as dead.

	Every morning, so far, I'm alive. And now
	the crows break off from the rest of the darkness
	and burst up into the skyâ€”as though

	all night they had thought of what they would like
	their lives to be, and imagined
	their strong, thick wings.

	September

	it rained in my sleep
	and in the morning the fields were wet

	I dreamed of artillery
	of the thunder of horses

	in the morning the fields were strewn
	with twigs and leaves

	as if after a battle
	or a sudden journey

	I went to sleep in the summer
	I dreamed of rain

	in the morning the fields were wet
	and it was autumn
